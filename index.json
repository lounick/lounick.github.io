It is used to assist them with the increasing difficulty of performing manipulation tasks in a scalable manner. The state-of-the-art in collaborative robots allows for simple LfD approaches that can handle limited parameter changes of a task. These methods however typically approach the problem from a control perspective and therefore are tied to specific robot platforms. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel motion planning approach that combines the benefits of LfD approaches with generic motion planning that can provide robustness to the planning process as well as scaling task learning both in number of tasks and number of robot platforms. Specifically, it introduces Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) based LfD as initial trajectories for the Stochastic Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP) framework. This allows for successful task execution even when the task parameters and the environment change. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for skill transfer between robots. In this case a task is demonstrated to one robot via kinesthetic teaching and can be successfully executed by a different robot. The proposed approach, coined Guided Stochastic Optimization for Motion Planning (GSTOMP) is evaluated extensively using two different manipulator systems in simulation and in real conditions. Results show that GSTOMP improves task success compared to simple LfD approaches employed by the state-of-the-art collaborative robots. Moreover, it is shown that transferring skills is feasible and with good performance. Finally, the proposed approach is compared against a plethora of state-of-the-art motion planners. The results show that the motion planning performance is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art.","tags":[],"title":"Guided Stochastic Optimization for Motion Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaos Tsiogkas","David M.

The proposed heuristic is compared against the GA heuristic solution for the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP) and the heuristic for the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP). It performs equally good with the COP heuristic in terms of utility with an increase in the execution time. When tested against the DOP problem it performs comparably good. In the worst case, it produces solutions with 13% less utility but requiring orders of magnitude less time than the state of the art. Finally, the proposed method is tested in a scenario where the budget consumption is changing during mission execution. It is shown that a new plan can be devised online, leading to increased mission performance.

The methodology used by ARROWS researchers identified archaeologists requirements for all the phases of a campaign.

One of the main goals of the ARROWS project was the development of a heterogeneous team of cooperating AUVs; these comprised of prototypes developed in the project and commercially available vehicles. Three different AUVs have been built and tested at sea: MARTA, characterized by flexible hardware modularity for easy adaption of payload and propulsion systems, U-CAT, a turtle inspired bio-mimetic robot devoted to shipwreck penetration and A-Size AUV, a small light weight vehicle which is easily deployable by a single person.

The uncertain and dynamic underwater environment can have an effect on the mission performance. More time and energy may be required, disallowing successful mission execution. This work proposes the usage of the correlated orienteering problem (COP) that maximises the utility of a sensing mission while respecting energy and time constraints. We propose a heuristic-based on genetic algorithms (GA) for the solution of the COP. This heuristic is compared against optimal mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) solutions.

A robotic team could perform better than a single robot, if certain challenges, such as action planning, coordination, and decision making, are successfully tackled. One key factor for the successful performance of a robotic team is the multi-robot task allocation. Specifically, the challenge is to define which robot executes which task, considering an efficient solution for the successful completion of the complex mission. The task allocation could be even more challenging when real-world communication constraints and uncertainties are presented, such as limited bandwidth, high latency and high packet loss. In the current study, we attempt to resolve the issue of a cooperative robotic team under communication constraints. To reach this goal, the use of a distributed world model for multi-robot task allocation is proposed. This ontology based distributed world model is capable of successfully handling to a great extent the aforementioned communications limitations, thus allowing successful mission execution even under harsh communication conditions. An efficient centralised task allocation mechanism, using k-means clustering, is described, and its performance is compared to a greedy centralised task allocation method. Experimental simulation results indicate that the efficient method performs better on average than the greedy one, without extra time requirements.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient multi-AUV cooperation using semantic knowledge representation for underwater archaeology missions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeyn A.
